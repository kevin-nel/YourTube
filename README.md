# YourTube

take back control of your youtube consumption. this script uses the [XML rss feed output file from youtube](https://www.youtube.com/subscription_manager) to fetch the last n amount of videos from each channel in your subscriptions.
This does not utilize the Youtube API and thus will not send data back to Youtube

2. Download this script 
3. cd into the directory and run in the terminal ``python3 Yourtube.py``
4. follow the instruction given
5. you can view the output files in the ``output`` directory


## examples of output

1. [txt](docs/output.txt)
2. [markdown](docs/output.md)
3. [html](docs/output.html)

## Modules used

this script makes use of the [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/BeautifulSoup/) module for parsing as well as the [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) module for fetching the xml files.

## TO DO

the following is yet to be implemented.

- make this script into a command line tool that can take input from anywhere and with any file name
  - example `yourtube path/to/xml/filename.xml -o html`
  - `-o` md/html/txt output
  - `-l` write list of links to stdout for use with piping into other programs such as [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)
  - `-i` feed in custom input (channel urls comma separated). example `yourtube -i channelurl_a, channelurl_b -o md`
  - `-n` number of videos per channel to fetch
- add ability to choose number of listings per channel âœ…
- add ability to input channel urls (as comma separated list)
- add youtube-dl support to download list of videos
